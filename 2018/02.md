# Wordpress - Gutenberg Release
## The good
* It's a step forward for the visual editor, which hasn't changed in years. Especially since the visual editor... sucks. It's also Mullenweg's answer to services like Wix and Squarespace
* Gutenberg leverages HTML comments to store block information, allowing (or encouraging) self-documenting blocks
* It's not obligatory -- you can disable Gutenberg and not break anything
* Copy and paste is a pleasant experience, for those who bring content over from other sources.
* You can [create your own blocks](http://wordpress.org/gutenberg/handbook/blocks/writing-your-first-block-type)

---

# Wordpress - Gutenberg Release
## The bad
* No more composing in the browser (although, how many people do this anyway?)
* The UI is still a bit clunky. Options are buried under additional clicks.
* No shortcodes in paragraphs (currently). Shortcodes must be used in "shortcode blocks"
* No images or other embeds in paragraphs. Images, as well as audio and video embeds, require their own block.
